# PART I — SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF HELICAL TIME  
**Helical Time & Wave-Emergent Matter Theory (HTC–WEM v7.3)**  
Full English Version

---

## 1. We are used to thinking that time is a straight line  
Past → Present → Future.  

It seems to us that there exists some static scale with dates and events that move forward by themselves, outside of our influence.

However, this understanding is only a surface-level approximation.  
It works in everyday life but stops being accurate when we look at the fundamental nature of time.

Time is not a linear scale and not an abstract vector.  
Time is a **physical phenomenon**, which has:

- density,  
- structure,  
- direction,  
- speed,  
- oscillatory nature.

If we consider time not as a line but as a **living process**, it becomes clear:  
it flows, bends, compresses, stretches — and reacts to matter the same way a wave reacts to dense or rarefied media.

---

## 2. Why time compresses and stretches
The step of the temporal spiral depends on the density of matter.

**The denser the matter → the tighter the spiral → the slower the time.**  
**The emptier the space → the wider the spiral → the faster the time.**

This expands General Relativity and embeds it into a larger wave-based picture.

---

## 3. Why dreams can show the future
If time is a spiral, neighboring turns lie close to each other.

During sleep, the mind releases its fixation on the current turn →  
shifts to a *neighboring one*, where probable future events reside.

This explains:
- prophetic dreams,  
- déjà vu,  
- intuition,  
- sudden insights,  
- premonitions.

**Consciousness is an antenna reading adjacent turns of the temporal spiral.**

---

## 4. Thought as a wave that changes the future
A thought is a wave with amplitude and phase.

- Intention = phase  
- Emotion = amplitude  

The wave propagates along the spiral → interacts with the Source of time →  
the spiral slightly adjusts.

Thus arise:
- prayer effects,  
- synchronicities,  
- "luck",  
- materialization-like effects.

This is wave physics, not mysticism.

---

## 5. How matter appears
Any stable structure is formed by the interference of four fundamental waves:

| Wave | Property it gives |
|------|-------------------|
| Time | life cycle |
| Light | form and boundaries |
| Sound | density |
| Gravity | mass and stability |

Stable particles = stable interference nodes.

---

## 6. What is destiny
If time is a spiral, destiny is simply the route along one turn.

But the turn can be:
- stretched,
- shifted,
- or shifted to a neighboring turn.

A strong impulse of consciousness → changes the shape of the spiral → fate changes.

---

## 7. You are a node of waves
You are the intersection of:
- temporal wave,  
- light wave,  
- sound wave,  
- gravitational wave,  
- and your own thought-wave.

You shape your own wave-form.

---

## 8. The simplest formula of the theory

> **Time is a wave.  
Matter is interference.  
Consciousness is the source of impulse.  
The future is a modifiable structure of the spiral.**

---

## 9. Scientific base  
Behind all this lies strict mathematics (Part II):
- metric of helical time,  
- density-dependence of temporal speed,  
- temporal direction vector,  
- wave functions of matter,  
- gradients,  
- topological winding,  
- falsifiable predictions.

---

## 10. Summary of Part I
Now you understand:
- why time is a spiral,  
- why dreams see the future,  
- why thought changes events,  
- why fate is modifiable,  
- why matter = waves,  
- how the Universe forms.

**HTC–WEM v7.3**

# 2. Axioms of Helical Time

## **A1. Time is a wave, not a coordinate**
Time is a **physical wave** with its own amplitude, frequency, and phase.  
It propagates through space and interacts with matter like light or sound.

---

## **A2. Time has density**

Time density decreases when the density of matter or gravity increases:

$$
h(\tau) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \rho_m + \rho_g}}.
$$

- high density → smaller \(h(\tau)\) → time slows  
- low density → larger \(h(\tau)\) → time approaches a straight-line flow  

---

## **A3. Time has structure — it is a helical wave**

Parametrization of a temporal turn:

$$
x(\tau)=R\cos(\omega\tau), \qquad
y(\tau)=R\sin(\omega\tau), \qquad
z(\tau)=\int h(\tau)\,d\tau.
$$

This defines the **geometry of temporal flow**.

---

## **A4. The source of time is an external impulse  
(Muntyan’s Principle)**

The fundamental excitation of time obeys:

$$
\delta E \cdot \delta t = \hbar.
$$

This “first impulse” breaks the symmetry of the standing wave of the metaverse, creating the temporal spiral.

---

# 3. Helical Time Metric

The physical time flow is described by:

$$
ds^2 = -c^2 d\tau^2 + R^2(\omega d\tau)^2 + h(\tau)^2 d\tau^2.
$$

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| \( -c^2 d\tau^2 \) | baseline temporal progression |
| \( R^2(\omega d\tau)^2 \) | rotational / winding component |
| \( h(\tau)^2 d\tau^2 \) | density component of time |

---

# 4. Temporal Vector

## **4.1 Direction of temporal flow**

Defined as the vector from the interaction of gradients of time density and matter density:

$$
\hat{v}_T = 
\frac{\nabla h \times \nabla \rho}{|\nabla h \times \nabla \rho|}.
$$

---

## **4.2 Speed of time**

$$
v_T = \frac{c}{\sqrt{\rho_m + \rho_g}}.
$$

---

# 5. Palette of Fundamental Waves  
**(Muntyan’s Law)**

Any physical structure arises from interference of four waves:

$$
\Psi(\vec r,t)
= \sum_i A_i\, \Psi_i(\vec r,t) \, e^{i\phi_i}.
$$

| Wave | Gives |
|------|-------|
| Time | life cycle |
| Light | form |
| Sound | density |
| Gravity | mass & inertia |

Matter = stable interference nodes.

---

# 6. Origin of Matter and Universe Structure

1. External impulse breaks the symmetry of the standing wave.  
2. **Time wave** appears.  
3. It excites light, sound, and gravitational modes.  
4. Modes interfere.  
5. Stable nodes appear → **particles**.  
6. Their ensembles form atoms → molecules → structures of the Universe.

---

# 7. Experimental Predictions

## **7.1 Density-based time dilation**

$$
v_T \propto \frac{1}{\rho_m}.
$$

## **7.2 Acceleration of time in vacuum**

If \(\rho_m \to 0\):

$$
v_T \to c.
$$

## **7.3 Vector Time Test (VTT)**  
Three atomic clocks placed on a circle → phase difference → direction of time.

## **7.4 Measuring time density**  
Clocks placed in air, water, metal → must tick at different speeds.

---

# 8. Falsifiability

The theory is wrong if:

- time flows identically everywhere,  
- \(h(\tau)\) does not depend on density,  
- there is no direction vector of time,  
- no wave interference,  
- VTT yields zero phase gradient.

---

# 9. Conclusion

Helical time:

- has structure,  
- has density,  
- interacts with matter,  
- forms cosmic structures,  
- can be measured experimentally.

Matter — interference nodes of fundamental waves.  
Time is not a line.  
**Time is a wave.**
